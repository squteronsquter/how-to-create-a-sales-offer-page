# How to Build a Sales Page with These Easy-to-Follow Steps

## Step One

Define and clearly describe ONE problem you will resolve for your potential client.
## Step Two

Describe the emotions which accompany the problem defined above. Show Your client that You understand what the client feels about the problem she/he has. 

Prove that You share the same emotions and values and that You can see the world with the client's eyes.

## Step Three

Introduce the solutions. Just show potential solutions which exist. By doing this we want to pour some hope into the client's heart. 

It is also important at this stage to show what would be the risk of not taking steps to do something about the client's problems. 

You may also show examples (there may be many of them) of solutions, and compare them to one another. This is not the right time to introduce your offer at this stage.

## Step Four

The "transition" stage, where You will slowly begin to introduce your offer. Show clearly why are you in the market, what are Your values and why You do what You do.

## Step Five

Position Your company in the market in the mind of Your potential client. Speak with easy-to-understand words about why Your offer is better, and how it is different from that of Your competitors. 

Try to describe what might have gone wrong with the other solutions in the market and convince Your potential customer that You can deliver a viable solution which is better than others.

## Step Six

This is now the time to state what Your offer is about. Write in clear, understandable language to make sure that Your audience understands everything. 

Do not use jargon or fancy language which may sound obscure.

## Step Seven

Create a detailed description of Your offer. Be specific about all features and be also clear about the benefits of each component. 

Do not write about features which are not important or may be regarded as discouraging eg. My eBook is 600 pages long. A feature like this might be discouraging without an explanation of why it is so long or so short.

## Step Eight

State Your prices or pricing model. Always stress the fact that the real value of the offer is greater than the actual price. Value for money is really important as everybody wants to get more for their hard-earned money.

## Step Nine

Make the offer scarce or limit its availability by time or money (or otherwise scarce). 

Offers which are the same regardless of time may lead clients to postpone their buying decisions.
For cooking or baking courses which have a specific date designated You may try to introduce "early bird prices".

## Step Ten

Provide information on what the customer needs to do to buy the offer or be able to use it e.g. fill out a questionnaire about the attendance or interview (if meals are offered during the course You may ask about dietary preferences, etc.)

Write in detail what will happen after the client makes a purchase eg. She/he will be contacted by the salesperson/liaison person who will introduce the client to the post-sales process.

A good example is a detailed description of how to get to the venue of the workshop for cooking/baking courses, etc.

## FAQ Section and Contact Information

It is also very important to provide a FAQ section as well as information about whom the client may contact if she/he has some other questions at the end of the sales page. 

Provide an email address or phone, and state when the client can call and how quickly she/he may expect to be contacted with a response. Do not make the client search for this information on the contact page. Just make it available directly on the sales page or the page of the product in the online shop.

## Punctuation and Spellchecking.

Remember to check spelling and punctuation before the offer is published.

A sloppy offer WILL NOT IMPRESS Your potential client. 

I have come across numerous online shops with sloppy product descriptions, apparently derived from haste. 

Editors want to "deliver" their offer to the audience as quickly as possible, without taking enough time to check their text before it is published.

_Do not follow this strategy!_

A sloppy copy can often act as a slap in the face of the reader.

Use online spell checkers or professional tools like Grammarly to make Your text look tidy and professional.

Thank You for Your attention.
