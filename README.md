# How to Build a Sales Page with These Easy to Follow Steps

## Step One

Define and clearly describe ONE problem you will resolve for your potential client

## Step Two

Describe the emotions which accompany the problem defined above. Show Your client that You understand what the client feels about the problem she/he has. Prove that You sahre the same emotions and values, and that You are able to see the world with the client's eyes.

## Step Three

Introduce the solutions. Just show potential solutions which exist. By doing this we want to pour some hope into the client's heart. It is also important at this stage to show what would be the risk of not taking steps to do something about the client's problems. You may also show examples (the may be many) of solutions, and compare them to one another. This is not the right time to introduce your offer at this stage.

## Step Four

The "transition" stage, where You will slowly begin to introduce your offer. Show clearly why are you in the market, what are Your values and why You do what You do.

## Step Five

Position Your company in the market in the mind of Your potential client. Speak with easy to understand words why Your offer is better, how it is different from that of Your competitors. Try to describe what might have gone wrong with the other solutions in the market and convince Your potential customer that You are able to deliver a viable solution which is better than others.

## Step Six

This is now the time to state what You offer is. Write in clear, understandable language to make sure that You audience understands everything. Do not use jargon or fancy language which may sound obscure.

## Step Seven

Create a detailed description of You offer. Be specific about all features and be also clear about the benefits of each component. Do not write about features which are not important or may be regarded as discouraging eg. My eBook is 600 pages long. Such feature might be discouraging without the explanation why it is so long or so short.

## Step Eight

State cleary Your prices or pricing model. Always stress the fact the the real value of the offer is greater than the actual price. Value for money id really important as everybody wants get get more for their hardearned money.

## Step Nine

Make the offer scarce and limit its availability by time or money (or otherwise scarce). Offers which are the same regardless of time may lead clients to postpone the buying decisions.

For cooking or baking courses which have a specific date designated You may try to introduce "early bird prices".

## Step Ten

Provide information what the customer needs to do to buy the offers or be able to use it eg. fill out a questionnaire about the attendance or interview (if meals are offered during the course You may ask about dietary preferences, etc.)

Write in detail what will happen after the client makes a purchase eg. He will be contacted by the sales person / liaison person who will introduce the client to the post sales process.

A good example is a detailed description of how to get to the venue of the workshop for cooking/baking courses, etc.

### At the end of the sales page it is also very important to provide a FAQ section as well as information about whom the client may contact if she/he has some other questions. Provide email address or phone, and state when the client can call and how quickly can she/he expect to be contacted with a response. Do not make the client search this information on the contact page. Just make it available directly on the sales page or the page of the product in the online shop.

Thank You for Your attention.
